# StudentBase Newbie Test
If you ace this you pass the technical part of the process


## Overview
So somehow, we have headhunted you to join our engineering team. The next step is to do well in this coding challenge. For this challenge, you will be making a web application that tracks daily water consumption (hydration is important). Users should be able to input each glass or bottle of water that they drink, and the app should tell the user how much more water they need to drink today. 

## Required features
- User should be able to add each glass or bottle of water they consume, and should be able to pick from a set of glass/bottle sizes (It is upto you to find out what are the most common glass/cup/bottle sizes, and portray them to the user in a friendly way).
- User should be able to see approximately how much water they have drank today, this month, and this year (the unit of measure is upto you).
- User should be able to see how much more water they should drink today.
- User should be able to login and persist their water consumption. You can use a naive authentication method (no encryption or tokens and stuff). You can also use a naive data storage (json file, text file, etc).

## Nice to have features
- A calendar view (smth like Google Calendar) of water consumption (Maybe your app can be focused around a calendar view).
- Gamification i.e. compare how much water you drink compared to your friends. 

## Required frameworks and tools
- You shoud use React with Typescript on the frontend. You should only use functional components and React hooks i.e. no class-based components.
- You should use a simple Node + GraphQL server (Typescript is optional here) for authentication and serving water consumption data to the user. Again, there is no need for a complex database, just use a json or text file to store user data (But if you want to use a DB, go ahead). 

## What you will be judged on
- Implementing the required features (50%)
- Clean code with well-defined types on the frontend (20%)
- User interface and experience (20%)
- Some additional or nice to have features (10%)

If you have any questions, just ping Ahsan. Good luck!
